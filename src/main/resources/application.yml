  # Transforms are used to modify specific play inputs and convert them to different kinds of inputs
  # These are quite complicated to use, and have limited use-cases, but in theory allow for rough
  # whitelists or blacklists, roundabout loading from some sources, and customization of how things are
  # requested.
  #
  # These are NOT EASY to set up, so if you want to use these, you'll need to look through the code
  # for how they work and what fields are needed. Also, it's possible this feature might get entirely
  # removed in the future if I find a better way to do this.

  # If you set this to true, it will enable the eval command for the bot owner. This command

  # WARNING:
  # This command can be extremely dangerous. If you don't know what you're doing, you could
  # cause horrific problems on your Discord server or on whatever computer this bot is running
  # on. Never run this command unless you are completely positive what you are running.
  #
  # DO NOT ENABLE THIS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS DOES OR HOW TO USE IT
  # IF SOMEONE ASKS YOU TO ENABLE THIS, THERE IS AN 11/10 CHANCE THEY ARE TRYING TO SCAM YOU
